all_words_in_title:
    when normalizing product title and query columns
    they get simplified, mainly because of lemmatization
    so if we have "walks" in title and "walk" in query
    then all_words_in_title will still match on that word.
    When using normalized qp the slope of the model line is a little bit steeper.
    When using only the feature all_words_in_title r-squared with normalized_qp.csv
    is 0.007. When using query_product.csv r-squared is 0.05.
    So all_words_in_title provides a better fit when using query_product.csv
    It does make sense because query_product is the real data
    and normalized_qp is "simplified" data because more words map to the same
    lemmatized word. Mainly because of the higher r-squared value 
    we used query_product.csv instead of normalized_qp.csv
